*Zea Lip*: An atlas of glycerolipid species across development in maize B73, CML312 inbreds and Palomero Toluqueño landrace.
-----------------------------

Here we present a developmental atlas of maize glycerolipid species. We collected tissues from three  maize lines: B73, CML312 and Palomero Toluqueño at different developmental stages, leaf types and areas of the leaf. We then analyzed this tissues using HPLC-MS and identified 171 glycerolipid species.

Check, search, browse and plot all the data using the [Zea Lip online app](https://rrlab.shinyapps.io/zea-lip/).
